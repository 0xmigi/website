**work experience**
FullStack Web3 Builder

[gasFees.lol](https://gasfees.lol/), remote - *(05/12/2021-present)*

Desinged and built a multi chain gas fee dashboard for tracking and comparing transaction costs across popular L1, L2 and, side chains. Still a work in progess but has around +-1000 users.

Solidity Developer

[MetAvatar](https://metavatar.digital/), remote – *(01/10/2021-present)*

Assisted in thinking through and building NFT minting page/website. Researched other projects code and wrote smart contracts designed for ongoing NFT platform.



Freelance Researcher

on-chain, remote – *(12/01/2021-present)*

Spent nearly a full year fascinated with blockchain technologies and mentally exploring what is possible using such a mechanism in society. Unpaid and for no reason other than following my own curiosity I have been exploring the space and learning all I can in order to eventually build something myself.

***
**Skills**


Solidity 

My programming language of interest, I have been learning it since May of 2021 starting with CryptoZombies and proceeding on through self taught methods. Currently I have reached a level of understanding useful enough to write simple smart contracts and read general open-source code I find interest in. 

 

Javascript 

Generally my most used programming language, I have been learning it alongside Solidity for 5 months now and depend on it to build front end interfaces and interact with the .sol contracts I have deployed. 



Typescript 

My more recent programming language endeavorer, I have been learning it due to it's static types and explicit preferences in my most recent job. Have been using it for a couple weeks so still quite inexperienced.



React JS

My UI building library of choice, as it seems to be one of the most popular in the space and works well with popular web3 tooling/documentation. Have built a couple websites with it and find it easy to work with/do what I want.

**Projects**

gasFees.lol - developer

* gasFees.lol is a multichain transaction fee tracking dashboard for client facing use. Allows anyone to search a wallet, ENS address, or connect a wallet and get all the historical transaction fees associated with that wallet. A work in progress but taking a lot of inspiration from Zapper.fi.


MetAvatar - smart contract developer

* MetAvatar is an educational and fun NFT Collection that will bring gamified learning to kids across the world. We will explore aspects of traditional education along with essential concepts and skills often overlooked by most formal schooling systems.
